                <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F/177°C</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, mix the apples and cranberries and lime juice in a bowl to combine. Sprinkle the flour, cinnamon, coconut sugar and the maple syrup over them and mix to combine. Pour into a greased casserole dish (I use a 2 QT. dish) and spread or shake to lay evenly. </li>
                    <li>In another bowl, mix all the crisp topping ingredients except the vegan butter. Add the vegan butter chunks in and use your fingers (or fork, or masher) to crumble it into the flour oats mixture until everything is moist and the butter is evenly distributed. It should look crumbly. Sprinkle the topping over the fruits. </li>
                    <li>Bake for 45 minutes on the middle rack until the crisp is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling and smells delicious. </li>
                    <li>Allow to cool slightly, then scoop out and serve immediately with some ice cream and sauce from the crisp. Enjoy!! </li>
                </ol>
